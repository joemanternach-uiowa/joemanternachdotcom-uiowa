                <p>
                    I am an avid outdoor enthusiast who enjoys running, biking, hiking, fishing, and camping. I find joy in staying active and connected to nature. <br><br>Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Iowa, with an expected graduation in December 2025. My academic journey has been enriched by my role as a teaching assistant in an electronics class. Additionally, I work as a part-time student quality engineer at John Deere. I have a passion for continuous learning, which inspired me to create my personal website to showcase my projects and skills.

                <h2>Temperature Sensor</h2>
                <p>One of my more advanced projects involved designing a temperature sensor based on the Seebeck effect. By leveraging the thermoelectric phenomenon, I was able to generate a voltage proportional to temperature differences. To ensure accurate signal readings, I implemented low-pass filters to remove noise and an instrumentation amplifier to enhance the small voltage signals generated. This project was a great opportunity to explore sensor design, analog signal processing, and amplification circuits. It furthered my understanding of precision measurement systems and how thermoelectric principles can be applied in practical engineering solutions.</p>

                <h2>Internet Protocol</h2>
                <p>I developed a custom internet protocol using Python, implementing TCP along with acknowledgment (ACK) and negative acknowledgment (NACK) packets to manage data transmission reliability. This protocol served as the backend for a game I created, where users could take care of virtual plants, buy new ones, and sell existing ones. The project was a deep dive into network protocols, error handling, and real-time communication. Designing both the protocol and the front-end game provided a unique challenge, merging my interests in networking and interactive software development.</p>

                <h2>Heart Rate Sensor</h2>
                <p>I developed a heart rate sensor that measures changes in blood oxygen levels using an infrared (IR) LED and an operational amplifier (op-amp) to detect small fluctuations in light absorption. As blood flows through the capillaries, the varying oxygen levels cause changes in light absorption, which the sensor detects and amplifies using the op-amp. This project introduced me to biomedical sensing technologies and the challenges of designing circuits for sensitive physiological measurements. It also enhanced my skills in analog circuit design and signal processing, as I worked to ensure accurate, real-time data collection.</p>

                <h2>Video Game Development</h2>
                <p>I've worked on several video game projects for fun and for class. One of my standout projects was a retro-style asteroid game I developed in C++, where I designed everything from the physics to the user interface. I also created a Mario-like platformer using Godot, which required applying object-oriented programming principles and game engine physics. These projects not only sharpened my coding skills but also gave me a sense of accomplishment through creative problem-solving and technical challenges.</p>

                <h2>PWM Motor Controller</h2>
                <p>Using a combination of a potentiometer, resistors, capacitors, and a MOSFET, I successfully created a system to precisely control motor speed. The experience deepened my understanding of motor control circuits and power electronics, while allowing me to apply hands-on skills in circuit design and troubleshooting. This project solidified my interest in working with embedded systems and control mechanisms, and I'm looking forward to expanding on it in future designs.</p>

                <h2>PID Controller</h2>
                <p>Another project that reflects my passion for control systems was the design and simulation of a PID controller using MATLAB. This project involved tuning the controller parameters to achieve optimal performance in regulating system behavior. I utilized digital signal processing techniques to model the system's response and ensure stability. Working on this project gave me valuable insights into control theory and real-world applications, furthering my interest in automation and system optimization.</p>
